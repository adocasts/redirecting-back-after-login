In this lesson, we'll learn an easy way we can safely redirect our user's back to their original page after they login or register in an AdonisJS application. We'll also verify the URL matches an actual GET route definition within our application.

- Persist an old forward path on invalid login attempts
- Verify the referrer is a valid URL
- Verify the referrer matches a valid GET route defined within our application
